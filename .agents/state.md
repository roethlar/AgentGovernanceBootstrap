# Agent State

This file is the first place future agents should read for current repo state.
Keep it short: `## Now` holds only live entries. At each `handoff`, rotate
landed or superseded entries verbatim to `docs/history/state-archive.md`.
Volatile facts carry `as of <commit>`; counts owned elsewhere are pointed to;
machine-local facts are labeled or omitted.

## Now

- Steady state as of `0d05c97` (2026-07-12): the 2026-07-08 zero-based
  consolidation is landed; the product shape is owned by
  `.agents/repo-guidance.md` (Mission Detail). Every 2026-07-10 plan is
  CLOSED with a commit map under `docs/superpowers/plans/` (full
  enumeration in the 2026-07-12 rotation in
  `docs/history/state-archive.md`); the 2026-07-09 external holistic
  review is fully triaged, with release engineering deferred by the
  release-posture decision. The owner ran this repo's self-refresh
  2026-07-10 (`32b598a`, toolkit `5574147`). New Active decision
  2026-07-11 (`0d05c97`): push status is never recorded in state files —
  git owns it; the change is template-side, so installed copies lag the
  templates by that one change — the expected steady state until the
  owner's next refresh (owner-only rule, `292a4d2`). The
  reviewloop-branches Open item was closed as adopted and archived
  2026-07-12 (`76c1e5f`). Rollout DONE for vela, Blit_v2, ai-rpg-engine,
  Powershell-Token-Killer (details in `docs/history/state-archive.md`).
  Per-harness capability record: `docs/harness-capabilities.md`.

## Next

- Per-repo verbosity/tech-level tuning sits Open in `.agents/decisions.md`
  awaiting an owner go for a plan.
- **ExchangeAdminWeb**, the last legacy rollout repo, deferred by the owner
  to **2026-07-20** (re-affirmed 2026-07-09): run `tools/refresh.py`,
  resolve FLAG lines; oldest instance — 2026-06-22-era template, no
  repo-guidance.md, so it needs the bootstrap procedure's carve-out, the
  same path qbit-mobile exercised (carve-out done, owner report
  2026-07-12). The owner's fleet refresh (run by 2026-07-12) propagated
  the 2026-07-10/11 template changes to governed repos.
